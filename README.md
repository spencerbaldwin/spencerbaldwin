# Hey, I'm Spencer 

CS senior at Texas State University with a background in Economics & Political Science. I like building things that work — cache simulators, autocomplete engines, digital circuits, and full-stack platforms.

Currently building **Zenyu Studios**, a mental health gaming platform for youth.

###  Featured Project

**Zenyu Studios** · *In Development — Demo Ready*  
A platform where youth can play, create, and publish their own mental health and wellness games. Features AI-powered game customization using the Claude API, Firebase authentication with Google sign-in, and Cloud Firestore for user profiles and published game data.

**Stack:** React · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Firebase Auth · Cloud Firestore · Anthropic Claude API · Vercel  
**Language:** JavaScript throughout — no backend server needed

### 🔧 Other Projects

**Mood Garden** · React  
Bilingual mental wellness platform for students with text-to-speech and internationalization.

**Cache Simulator** · C++  
Configurable simulator supporting direct-mapped and associative caches with LRU, MRU, and Lookahead replacement policies. Analyzed memory access traces to optimize hit/miss efficiency.

**Autocomplete Engine** · C++  
Recursive trie-based autocomplete with prefix search and ranked suggestions. Optimized node structures for memory-efficient storage.

**Integer ALU** · Verilog  
Digital Arithmetic Logic Unit supporting arithmetic, logical, and bit-shift operations. Verified with 100+ simulation test cases using waveform analysis.
