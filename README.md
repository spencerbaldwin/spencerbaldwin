# Hey, I'm Spencer 

CS senior at Texas State University with a background in Economics & Political Science. I like building things that work — cache simulators, autocomplete engines, digital circuits, and now full-stack web apps.

Currently exploring mental health tech and game development at **Zenyu Games**.

### 🔧 What I've Built

**Cache Simulator** · C++  
Configurable simulator supporting direct-mapped and associative caches with LRU, MRU, and Lookahead replacement policies. Analyzed memory access traces to optimize hit/miss efficiency.

**Autocomplete Engine** · C++  
Recursive trie-based autocomplete with prefix search and ranked suggestions. Optimized node structures for memory-efficient storage.

**Integer ALU** · Verilog  
Digital Arithmetic Logic Unit supporting arithmetic, logical, and bit-shift operations. Verified with 100+ simulation test cases using waveform analysis.

**Mood Garden** · React  
Bilingual mental wellness platform for students with text-to-speech and internationalization.
